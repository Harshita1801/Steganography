# Steganography
Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone 
cannot know the presence or contents of the hidden message. The purpose of steganography is to conceal 
and deceive.
Least Significant Bit Embeddings (LSB) are a general steganographic technique that may be employed 
to embed data into a variety of digital media. Digital image as a finite set of digital values, called pixels. 
Pixels are the smallest individual element of an image which hold values that represent brightness and 
colour at any specific point. 
The mini-project is completely based on the high-level language, Python and the DBMS language, SQL 
and uses GUI programming to provide a simple and easy to understand platform for the users.
DBMS is used to store the file information which is used in Steganography.
